Write a function that splits a string and returns an array of each word of the string.

-use the strtok() function to split the string into smaller individual tokens based on delimiters
-delimiters are characters found on the string, the functio uses these delimiters to split the input string into token s
-now declare two variables to store the string and the other to store the split string tokens
-begin a loop to tokenise the string get the next token and print them out one by one.
