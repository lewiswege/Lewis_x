This program calculates the average marks of five students or any five integers, using an array thag takes five elements. You can edit the aarray and increase its size to accomodate more values, depending on your desires. i used a loop to always ask for input from the user and store it in the array.

I acces the elements again using a loop to calculate the average and print out the result.
